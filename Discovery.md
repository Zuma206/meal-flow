Meal flow takes all the effort out of planning your meals and shopping for ingredients. It can:

- Keep track of what you have in stock
- Store recipes for you
- Generate a meal plan for each week
- Create a shopping list of what you need, excluding what you already have

All this creates an experience that ensures you don't even have to think about meals, whilst minimizing waste, and keeping variety high.
